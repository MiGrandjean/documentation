[[opsi-404-releasenotes-eol]]
== Discontinuation

This chapter lists the discontinued versions. For several reasons, these distribution versions will not be supported by opsi anymore.

[[opsi-404-releasenotes-eol_python25]]
=== Discontinuation of Python 2.5 support

With this service release the official support for Python 2.5 is discontinued. This regards the Python 2.5 distributions: Debian Lenny and UCS 2.x. The affected repositories will be closed by the end of 2013. At that time the current packets will be moved to the archive of download.uib.de. For affected opsi systems we recommend upgrading to new distributuion versions that still are supported.

[[opsi-404-releasenotes-eol_distros]]
=== Discontinuation: distribution versions

The following systems are discontinued because of lack of manufacturer maintenance:

** UCS 2
** Debian Lenny

The regarded repositories will be closed by the end of 2013. For corresponding installations, we urgently recommend upgrading the OS. Before doing so, please check that the selected version is supported by opsi.



[[opsi-404-releasenotes-installation]]
== Installation notes

Before installing the updates, for safety reasons we recommend making a backend backup with opsi-backup:
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-backup create
----

The products contained within this Release in several parts are dependent from each other. So install the Release as a packet and don’t try to install just some parts of it.

As the first step you should create a server update, and then install the opsi products.

To install the testing server packets, change the opsi repository from 'opsi40' to 'opsi40-testing'. +
For example Ubuntu 12.04: +
`deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/uibmz:/opsi:/opsi40/xUbuntu_12.04 ./` +
replace by: +
`deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/uibmz:/opsi:/opsi40-testing/xUbuntu_12.04 ./`

Then update your packets. +
For example Ubuntu / Debian:
[source,prompt]
----
aptitude update
aptitude dist-upgrade
----

To make the new opsi_depot_rw share and the `sudo opsi-set-rights` available, please execute:
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-setup --patch-sudoers-file
opsi-setup --auto-configure-samba
----


for installing the testing opsi products 
[source,prompt]
----
cd /home/opsiproducts
mkdir opsi404
cd opsi404
wget -r -l1 -nc -nd -A "*.opsi" http://download.uib.de/opsi4.0/testing/404/
opsi-package-manager -i *.opsi
----
If the wget command fails, the http_proxy environment variable might have to be set (like http_proxy=http://192.168.1.5:8080/)

////
The installation does not afford any special approach. It is done with the standard procedure of updating the server and the opsi products..

First you should update the server and then the opsi products. This will be done by the opsi-product-updater:

[source,prompt]
----
opsi-product-updater -i -vv
----
////

In case of a multi depot installation, first upgrade the config-server, then upgrade the depots.

[[opsi-configed]]
== opsi-configed 4.0.4.1

[[opsi-configed-main-savedstates]]
=== The current group will be saved

The '{opsi-configed}' now saves on the local machine and for the current user the current group selection. On the next start of configed, the current group is loaded, so managing this group can be continued.

[[opsi-configed-main-menubar]]
=== Extended main menu bar
The '{opsi-configed}' now has in the main menu bar, besides the three buttons for selecting the main window mode, three buttons for invoking other action windows (before there was just the license manager). 

So now it is six buttons in total:

* client configuration
* depot properties
* server configuration
* group actions
* packet actions
* license management

.'{opsi-configed}': Button bar with the new buttons for group actions and packet actions
image::../images/configed-masterbuttons2.png["{opsi-configed}: Button bar with the new buttons for group actions and packet actions", width=400]


[[opsi-configed-groupactions]]
=== Group actions

The window "group actions" provides the starting point for group related functions. Currently it offers just one function, which is used by the opsi-localimage-Option: 

* to search for an operating system, that had been installed on all of the clients of the selected group and therefore can be offered for all of the clients of that group. 

.'{opsi-configed}': Group actions (for opsi-local-image)
image::../images/configed_groupaction_localimage.png["{opsi-configed}: Group actions (for opsi-local-image)", width=400]


[[opsi-configed-packageactions]]
=== Product actions

The window "product actions" offers two features:

* An .opsi file (opsi packet) can be selected or entered and can be uploaded to the opsi server; the default upload directory on the server is the network (samba) share named opsi_workbench. The button click starts installing the packet on the server, like invoking the opsi-package-manager.

* The WinPE files and install files for an Windows product (Windows Vista and above) can be uploaded to the server product directory (share opsi_depot), so that windows products do not have to be managed from the server side.

.'{opsi-configed}': packet  and product actions

[[opsi-configed-host-actions]]
=== OpsiCLient menu actions

[[opsi-configed-host-actions-disabling]]
==== Enabling and disabling of the client add and remove feature

There is a host parameter (Config) `configed.host_actions_disabled` to configure, whether from the '{opsi-configed}' clients can be added or removed. 

The configuration parameters are:

* `add client`
* `remove client`

the '{opsi-configed}' allows multiple selection, so both parameters can be selected. 
The default is <empty>, so none is selected. Which means adding and removing clients is enbled. 

The default setting can be changed so that adding and removing clients from the  '{opsi-configed}' is disabled:

[source,prompt]
----
opsi-admin -d method config_createUnicode "configed.host_actions_disabled" "Disable host actions" ["add client","remove client"] ["add client","remove client"] false true
----


[[opsi-configed-host-actions-wakeonlan]]
==== WakeOnLan feature with delay

For the WakeOnLan feature now can be selected, whether to send the network signal immediately to all selected clients, or with a selected delay between each client. When using delays, the '{opsi-configed}' is managing the delays and performing the action. So it must continue to run until the last WakeOnLan is signalled.

[[opsi-configed-host-actions-opsiclientd-event]]
==== Triggering special opsiclientd events 

The '{opsi-configed}' now can trigger some more special actions on the clients (opsiclientd) in addition to the default event "on_demand". This feature requires special entries in the opsiclientd.conf. Which events (in addition) can be triggered on the client, can be set by server host properties.

[[opsi-configed-host-actions-delete-package-caches]]
==== For WAN clients: empty the packet cache

In case WAN clients need to empty the packet cache, now there is an '{opsi-configed}' feature to reset the cache.


[[opsi-configed-productconfiguration]]
=== New feature of the product configuration

[[opsi-configed-productconfiguration-searchfunction]]
==== search function

With the search function products can be searched by product names and (if desired) in combination with special values in the fields of the product table (like searching the client table). 
Therefore a search string can be entered. The search starts immediately and the first matching line is marked . If there is no match to be found (or characters are removed from the search string), the first line of the table is marked. 

The context menu offers some more options.

.'{opsi-configed}': Product search with context menu
image::../images/configed_productsearch.png["{opsi-configed}: Product search with context menu", width="300"]

To get a better overview, activating the filter function reduces the product view to the selected products only. The selections stays active until the filter is disabled by clicking the filter button again.

[[opsi-404-releasenotes-ucs]]
== UCS

With opsi 4.0.4 service release also UCS 3.2 for opsi4ucs is supported.

[[opsi-404-releasenotes-ucs-executablebit]]
=== UCS Executable bit fix

Since the update of the samba packets in UCS 3.1-1 and above there is a problem accessing the opsi depot share. Every executable file on the opsi depot share must have the executable bit set on the server site, so that Windows clients may execute these files. Excepted from this change is the UCS administration account.

vgl. https://forum.opsi.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4810

With the 4.0.4 release this problem is solved by adding the groups pcpatch and  opsifileadmins as adminusers in the share configuration of the opsi_depot share. So accessing the opsi depot share performs as usual..

This change has been made to the opsi_depot share only, for it is the main opsi share and published as ReadOnly.

If you need this change also for some other shares (like the opsi_workbench), you can add it manually for these shares. In this case edit the share.conf file of that share, which is to be found in `/etc/samba/shares.conf.d`. Add the following line:

[source,prompt]
----
admin users = administrator join-backup @$fileadmingroup
----

WARNING: The UCR variable:
`samba4/ntacl/backend`
has been set to None for the former UCS 3.0 fix, with the new version it is reset to 'native'.

[[opsi-404-releasenotes-ucs-fwRules]]
=== Changes of the firewall rules

With the 4.0.4 release the opsi firewall rules have been changed. The firewall rules used to be set in the template file: `/etc/security/packetfilter.d/50_local.sh`. 
Mainly the setting is about two ports:

. TCP 4447 opsi-Webservice
. UDP 69 tftp

This configuration with the new version is withdrawn to be set with ucr as registry variables. The new firewall rules are set as `package` rules and can be managed by UCR (to read, modify, deactivate, delete).

For details please refer to the UCS documentation.

[[opsi-404-releasenotes-ucs-sambareload]]
=== UCS Samba reload

With the current version UCS 3.2-0 the switch `reload` has been removed from the samba startscript. Therefore the opsi join script is changed to `force-reload`. Using `force-reload` is the same as restart, whereas reload just reloaded the configuration file (smb.conf).

With the Univention roles Master and Backup, after the installation of opsi packets the join script is executed automatically, so samba is restarted. Please have this in mind when installing opsi packets.
