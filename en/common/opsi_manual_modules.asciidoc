[[opsi-manual-modules]]
== Activation of non free modules

Even opsi is open source, there are some components which are not free at the moment. At this time (June 2012) the following components of opsi are not free:

* the MySQL backend for configuration data (see <<opsi-manual-backends-mysql-configdata-overview>>)
* license management (see <<opsi-manual-licensemanagement>>) 
* WAN/VPN extension (see <<opsi-manual-wansupport>>)
* Dynamic Depot Assignment (see <<opsi-manual-dyndepot>>)
* User Profile Management (see <<opsi-manual-userprofile>>)
* opsi Nagios Connector (see <<opsi-Nagios-Connector>>)

See also at our website: http://uib.de/en/opsi_cofunding/index.html

These components are developed in a co-funding project which means that until the complete development costs are payed by co-funders, they are only allowed to use by the co-funders or for evaluation purposes. If we have earned the development cost we will give these modules for everybody for free. To control the use of these components until they are free there is a activation file `/etc/opsi/modules`, which is protected against changes via electronic signature. If this activation file doesn't exist, only the 'free' parts of opsi will work.

If you need for evaluation a temporary valid activation file please contact info@uib.de. If you become a co-funder, you will get a unlimited activation file. 

If you got an activation file, copy this file as 'root' to `/etc/opsi/modules`. If this is done, execute:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --set-rights /etc/opsi
----

You may check your activation state with one of the following methods:

Using the 'opsi-configed' choose the menu entry 'Help/opsi-Module' which shows a window with the activation state.

.Display of activation state in opsi-configed

At the command line you may use the command {opsi-admin} with the method `backend_info`. (Remark: Never give your activation file or the output of this command to third people without deleting the signature).
